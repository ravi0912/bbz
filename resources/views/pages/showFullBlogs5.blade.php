                <h1>Green Construction</h1>
                <p>
                    The green building sector is booming in the industry. Not only is it providing solutions for
                    economics construction, but also is generating large amount of jobs as well. According to a
                    recent USGBC study from  Booz Allen Hamilton, the growth rate of green construction is
                    rapidly outpacing those of conventional construction and will continue to rise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sector accounted for more than 2.3 million American Jobs in 2015 according to a
                    recent U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) study from <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/press-releases/learn-more-about-austrian-green-construction-summer-programme-at-ecobuild/s66/a600999/"><i>
                            Booz Allen Hamilton</i></a>.
                    "Green building is playing a massive role in the U.S. construction sector, the clean and
                    efficient energy sector and the U.S. economy as a whole," said Rick Fedrizzi (CEO and
                    founding chair of the USGBC), "More than 2.3 million U.S. workers are taking home $134
                    billion annually in large part because of green building programs like LEED. Demand for
                    green building will only continue to grow as individuals, businesses and institutions continue
                    to prioritize sustainable approaches to the design, construction and operations of our built
                    environment."
                    It has been estimated in the same report that by 2018, the green construction will account
                    for more than 3.3 million U.S. jobs which is more than one third of the entire construction
                    industry. It currently chips in more than $130 billion in labor income for working
                    Americans!
                    Green construction is a process of finding a delicate balance between construction and
                    sustainable development/environment. It is the use of resources involved in construction
                    more efficiently while creating more energy efficient structures.

                    In simpler words, <a href="http://www.greenbuildingsolutions.org/Main-Menu/What-is-Green-Construction"><i>green building</i></a>
                    is one which uses less water, optimises energy efficiency,
                    conserves natural resources, generates less waste and provides healthier spaces for
                    occupants, as compared to a conventional building.
                    Success can be measured by the measure of footprint left on the environment by the
                    project. It can be minimised through conservation of resources and through use of energy
                    efficient, cost-effective & low maintenance products for all construction needs.

                    Green construction can be seen making an impact in India as well.
                    The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, and the Confederation of Real Estate
                    Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI), apex body of private real estate developers,
                    have partnered to promote green buildings in the country through IFC's EDGE certification.
                    An MoU was signed in the presence of Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash
                    Javadekar on November 25, 2014.
                </p>

                    In Tamil Nadu, the government is planning to build solar-powered green houses for rural
                    poor. It has allotted Rs. 1,080 crore for construction of 60,000 houses.
                    In Maharashtra, near Mumbai in the Thane District, Govardhan Eco Village, a community in
                    India, has built buildings with compressed stabilized Earth blocks, Rammed Earth Technique,
                    Cob Houses(ADOBE Bricks) with traditional thatched roofs. These buildings have received a
                    five-star rating from <a href="http://www.grihaindia.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87"><i>GRIHA</i></a>, an Indian Nationwide Green Standards for Buildings, a wing of
                    the famous TERI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These examples showcase the ability of the Indian market & economy to blend into latest
                    trends of construction industry. One can safely assume that in the coming time, Green
                    Construction will play a vital role not only in the Indian market but at a global level and will
                    surely change many aspects of construction practices.
