<h1>Guwahati edged over other cities by experts in terms of earthquake safety</h1>
<p>
 International scientific agency from Norway called NORSAR has in its report states that the resilience 
 of buildings in Guwahati to probable earthquake is far better than buildings studied in other cities of India. (first reported by <i>TheNortEastToday</i>)
</p>
<p>
This project examined aprox. 16,000 buildings samples in Guwahati. Experts from Norway and Assam 
Engineering College have imposed simulated earthquakes like the Nepal earthquake or even bigger 
including the Great Assam earthquake of 1897 and 1950 and their impact on these buildings. They 
have just concluded their studies and submitted their final report which states that the resilience 
power of buildings in Guwahati to probable earthquake is far better than buildings studied in 
other cities of India.

In Guwahati, no high rise building can be constructed without the services of licensed; architects, 
engineers, structural engineers, geotechnical engineers and field supervisors. The design prepared by 
the Structural Engineer has to be vetted by a Structural Design Review Panel like IIT Guwahati and 
Assam Engineering College.

P.K Sharma, President of AREIDA has said, “Assam must learn to live with earthquakes; and Guwahati 
cannot escape high rise buildings due to scarcity and affordability of residential land.”
